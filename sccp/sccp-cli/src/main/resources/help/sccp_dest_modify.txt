Name
	sccp dest modify

SYNOPSIS
	sccp dest modify <sap-id> <id> first-dpc <first-dpc> last-dpc <last-dpc> first-sls <first-sls> last-sls <last-sls> 
	sls-mask <sls-mask> stackname <stack-name>


DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to modify the values of a Destination previously defined for
	a Service Access Point.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters
                                              
	<sap-id>	-	The identifier of the SAP whose Destination is being 
				modified. 

	<id>		-	The identifier of the Destination that is being modified.

	Optional Parameters

	<first-dpc>	-	The first value of the remote signaling point codes range.

	<last-dpc>	-	The last value of the remote signaling point codes range. 
				If the Destination specifies only a single Signaling 
				Point Code, this value must be equal to the value 
				specified for 'first-dpc'.

	<first-sls>	-	The first value of the SLS range. 
				SLS value range is from 0 to 255.

	<last-sls>	-	The last value of the SLS range. 

	<sls-mask>	-	The mask value. SLS of a message will be exposed by 
				performing a bitwise AND operation with this mask prior to
				comparing it with first-sls and last-sls values.

	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed. 
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used.				

EXAMPLES
	sccp dest modify 1 1 first-dpc 201 last-dpc 299 first-sls 0 last-sls 255 sls-mask 255 

	The above command will modify the values of the Destination identified by the
	number '1' within the Service Access Point identified by the number '1'. 
	The new values for 'first-dpc', 'last-dpc', 'first-sls', 'last-sls' and 'sls-mask'
	are 201, 299, 0, 255 and 255 respectively.
