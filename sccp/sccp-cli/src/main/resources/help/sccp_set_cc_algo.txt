Name
	sccp set cc_algo 

SYNOPSIS
	sccp set cc_algo <international | levelDepended> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	Sets the algorithm of the congestion control at SCCP level for outgoing messages.
	Possible values are international or levelDepended.
	international algorithm - only one level is provided by MTP3 level (in MTP-STATUS primitive).
	Each MTP-STATUS increases N / M levels
	international algorithm - MTP3 level (MTP-STATUS primitive) provides 3 levels of a congestion
	(1-3) and SCCP congestion will increase to the next level after MTP-STATUS next level
	increase (MTP-STATUS 1 to N up to 3, MTP-STATUS 2 to N up to 5, MTP-STATUS 3 to N up to 7)

	Default value is international.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<cc_algo>	-	international | levelDepended.

	Optional Parameters

	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed. 
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used.
