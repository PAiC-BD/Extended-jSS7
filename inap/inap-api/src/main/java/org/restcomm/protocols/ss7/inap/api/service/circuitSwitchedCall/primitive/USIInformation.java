-- Indicates the length of the USIInformation element, maxUSIInformationlength will depend on

-- Its content is network signalling/operator specific.
-- The internal structure of this parameter can be defined using ASN.1 and the related Basic

-- information) is the BER encoding of the defined ASN.1 internal structure.
-- The tag of this parameter as defined by ETSI is never replaced.
