<code>
LegID::= CHOICE {

  -- used in operations sent from SCF to SSF receivingSideID[1] LegType
  -- used in operations sent from SSF to SCF
}
-- Indicates a reference to a specific party in a call. OPTIONAL denotes network operator specific use with
-- unilateral ID assignment. OPTIONAL for LegID also denotes the following:
-- - when only one party exists in the call, this parameter is not needed (as no ambiguity exists).
-- - when more than one party exists in the call, one of the following alternatives applies:
-- 1) LegID is present and indicates which party is concerned.
-- 2) LegID is not present and a default value is assumed (e.g., calling party in the case of the
-- ApplyCharging operation).

LegType::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(1))
leg1 LegType::= '01'H
leg2 LegType::= '02'H

Other simple primitives:
Duration::= INTEGER (-2..86400)
-- Values are seconds. Negative values denote a special value, refer to the procedure description of the
-- relevant operations for further information.

Integer4::= INTEGER (0..2147483647)

Interval::= INTEGER (-1..60000)
-- Units are milliseconds. A -1 value denotes infinite.

ServiceKey::= Integer4
-- Information that allows the SCF to choose the appropriate service logic.
