 <code>
MonitorMode ::= ENUMERATED {
  interrupted (0),
  notifyAndContinue (1),
  transparent (2)
}
-- Indicates the event is relayed and/or processed by the SSP.
-- If this parameter is used in the context of charging events,
-- the following definitions apply for the handling of charging events:
-- Interrupted means that the SSF notifies the SCF of the charging event using
-- EventNotificationCharging, does not process the event but discard it.
-- NotifyAndContinue means that SSF notifies the SCF of the charging event using
-- EventNotificationCharging, and continues processing the event or signal without
-- waiting for SCF instructions.
-- Transparent means that the SSF does not notify the SCF of the event.
-- This value is used to end the monitoring of a previously requested charging event.
-- Previously requested charging events are monitored
-- until ended by a transparent monitor mode, or until the end of the connection configuration.
-- For the use of this parameter in the context of BCSM events refer to clause 18.
