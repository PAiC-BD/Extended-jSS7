		<title>Upgrade Notes</title>
		<para>
			If you are upgrading to &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; &THIS.VERSION; from version 6.1.2.GA, make sure you delete the <filename>SccpStack_sccpresource.xml</filename> and <filename>SccpStack_sccprouter.xml</filename> files from the persist directory. These are the files where SCCP persists configurations. You must delete these files and execute the SCCP commands again from CLI. This is because, starting from version 6.1.3.GA, XML tags of the persist directory were changed to use nouns (similar to M3UA and SCTP) instead of fully qualified class names. You do not have to do anything if you are upgrading from version 6.1.3.GA.
