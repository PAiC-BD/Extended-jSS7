				<listitem><para>Consider a scenario where SCCP stack is configured with multiple rsp, SCCP Rule1 is configured to use PC1 as primary and PC2 as secondary. Now if messages are received from PC2 and consumed by SCCP-User and replies back, if the GT matches for Rule1 then it will use PC1 for outgoing message instead of PC2. This is a known issue and will be fixed in future release.</para></listitem>
