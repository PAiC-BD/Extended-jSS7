	<title>Installation Options</title>
<para>The &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; is logically divided into two sections - lower and upper. The lower section provides implementation for SS7 Level 2 and Level 3 and is therefore influenced by the type of SS7 hardware (Level 1) used. The upper section provides implementation for SS7 Level 4 and above. &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; gives you the flexibility to install and use the Levels 2,3 and 4 in the same JVM and machine where SS7 Hardware (Level 1) is installed. Alternately, you can also install Level 1,2 and 3 in one machine and install Level 4 on a separate machine. In the second scenario, <literal>M3UA</literal> over <literal>SCTP</literal> is used for communication between Level 3 and Level 4 (on different machines) and this is referred to as &THIS.PLATFORM; Signaling Gateway.</para>
	<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; can be installed to function as a standalone component if you do not wish to use JBoss Application Server. However if you intend to use JSLEE Resource Adaptors or Shell (CLI), then you must deploy it as a JBoss AS Service. The sections below provide instructions for installing the Stack for use with JBoss AS or as a standalone component. </para> 

	<section id="running_with_jboss">
		<title>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; as a JBoss AS Service</title>
			<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; SS7 Service can be deployed in any container that supports
                        <literal>JMX</literal> and exposes <literal>JNDI</literal>.
                        By using the &THIS.PLATFORM; SS7 Service you will be able to configure the SS7 stack using CLI (Command Line Interface) commands. The SS7 Service wraps SS7 Level 4 (i.e., MAP, CAP and ISUP) and the lower layers and exposes via JNDI, such that the layer above can perform the look-up and use it in any application.
