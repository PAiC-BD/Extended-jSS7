[[_managing_linksets_using_cli]]
== Using CLI



You can manage Linksets and Links using CLI or GUI.
You can create, delete, activate and deactivate linksets and links using the Shell command `linkset` with appropriate parameters.
The `linkset` command can be used only when dahdi based cards are configured.                

[[_managing_linksets_using_gui]]
== Using GUI

The GUI will allow you to manage your linksets and links efficiently using a user-friendly interface.
Open a Web Browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/jss7-management-console/. Click on the 'linkset' link in the left panel.
The main panel will display the names of all configured Linkset Management units.
To configure or view the settings of a particular Linkset Management Unit you must click on the name of that unit.
The GUI will look similar to the figure below and is divided into two tabs. 

.GUI - Linkset Management
image::images/GUI_Linkset_Management.png[]

The first tab will display the properties of the Linkset Management unit.
These details displayed here are fetched from the XML descriptor file [path]_jboss-beans.xml_, which is  located at [path]_$JBOSS_HOME/server/profile_name/deploy/restcomm-ss7-service/META-INF_, where  [app]`profile_name` is the server profile name.
These properties cannot be modified here in the GUI.
To modify them you must modifiy the [path]_jboss-beans.xml_ and restart the Server.
The GUI will then display the modified values.
 

The other tab will allow you to manage all Linksets and Links within this Linkset Management unit.
 

[[_shell_linkset_show]]
== View all Linksets and Links

[[_shell_linkset_show_cli]]
=== Using CLI

You can view the current status of all correctly configured Linksets and Links by issuing the command `linkset show` as described below: 

----

Name
	linkset show

SYNOPSIS
	linkset show

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to view all Links and Linksets and their states. 

	The possible states of a Linkset are:

	- UNAVAILABLE	:	Indicates that the Linkset does not have any 'available' 
				links and cannot transport traffic.

	- SHUTDOWN	:	Indicates that Linkset has been shutdown.

	- AVAILABLE	:	Indicates that the Linkset has atleast one 'available' 
				link and can transport traffic.

	The possible states of a Link are:

	- UNAVAILABLE	:	Indicates that the Link is not 'available' to transport
				traffic. A Link is 'unavailable' if the Link is remotely 
				or locally inhibited by a user. It can also be 
				'unavailable' if MTP2 has not been able to successfully 
				activate the link connection.

	- SHUTDOWN	:	Indicates the Link has been shutdown in the configuration. 

	- AVAILABLE	:	Indicates the Link is active and 'available' to transport 
				traffic.

	- FAILED	:	Indicates that the Link is not 'shutdown' but is 
				'unavailable' at Layer 2 for some reason. For example, the
				Initial Alignment may fail, or the link test messages sent
				by MTP 3 are not being acknowledged.
----

[[_shell_linkset_show_gui]]
=== Using GUI

Navigate to the specific Linkset Management unit and switch to the 'Linksets' tab.
Here you can view a list of all the Linksets created.
Every correctly configured Linkset will be displayed in a row and for each Linkset, the first column will display the name of the Linkset.
The icon adjacent to the name will be lit 'green' if the Linkset is currently active or 'orange' if inactive.
The second column will indicate the current mode of the Linkset (Configured / Not Configured), the third column will allow you to activate / deactivate the Linkset and the fourth column will allow you to delete the Linkset. 

To view the details of all the Links created within a specific Linkset click on the name of the Linkset whose details you wish to view.
This will launch the 'Links' view and display all the configured properties of the selected Linkset in the first tab.
The second tab in this view will allow you to view all Links in this particular Linkset.
You can click on any Link name here to view the configured properties.
You can click on the bread crumbs at the top to return to any of the previous pages you navigated through.
