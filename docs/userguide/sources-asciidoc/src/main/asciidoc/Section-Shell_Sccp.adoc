= SCCP Management Commands

SCCP provides connectionless and connection-oriented network services.
This includes address(GTT) translation and routing, flow control segmentation and reassembly.
 

A global title is an address (e.g., a dialed 800 number, calling card number, or mobile subscriber identification number) which is translated by SCCP into a destination point code and subsystem number.
A subsystem number uniquely identifies an application at the destination signaling point.  is used as the transport layer for 			-based services 

The first step for SCCP configuring is a service access points (sap) definition.
This step is mandatory.
Each SCCP stack can use one or more Mtp3UserPart (Refer <<_configuring_sccp>> about Mtp3UserPart setting). A sap is a logical definition of the Mtp3UserPart (corresponded local SPC, network indicator (NI) and a set of destinations (remote SPC list)). The index of a sap must correspont to the index of the sap.
 

The second step is a definition of a list of available remote signaling pointcodes (SPC - rsp) and  a list of available remote Sub-Systems (SNN - rss). This step is also mandatory.
If routing only by GlobalTytle is used the remote Sub-Systems configuring is not required. 

As  acts as message router, it requires means to configure routing information.
Rules (rule), primary (primary_add) and backup (backup_add) (if backup addresses are available) addresses should be configured. 

If XUDT and LUDT messages are availavle in the SS7 network, user should config a set of long message rules (lmr) that will allow long messages.
This step is not mandatory.
If no long message rule is configured only UDT messages will be used. 

The last step is also optional.
A user can configure a set of concerned signaling point codes (csp). Each point code will be announced when local SCCP user becomes (un)available. 

User can also configure general SCCP parameters (Refer <<_shell_sccp_param>> about general parameters setting). 

[[_sap_management]]
== Service access points and destinations management

SCCP service access points (sap) and destinations (dest)  are managed by `sccp sap` and `sccp dest` commands.
They allows to perform following:

* `sccp sap create`
* `sccp sap modify`
* `sccp sap delete`
* `sccp sap show`
* `sccp dest create`
* `sccp dest modify`
* `sccp dest delete`
* `sccp dest show`

[[_shell_sccpsap_create]]

Sap can be created by issuing command with following structure:

[source]
----

----

<id>::
  A unique number to identify this sap

<mtp3-id>::
  A Mtp3UserPart index that is used as an index of mtp3UserPart property for SccpStack bean.

For each of sap one or more destinations should be configured.
Refer to <<_shell_sccpdest_create>> for details.
