= TCAP Management

Transaction Capabilities Application Part  , from ITU-T recommendations Q.771-Q.775 or ANSI T1.114 is a protocol for Signalling System 7 networks.
Its primary purpose is to facilitate multiple concurrent dialogs between the same sub-systems on the same machines, using Transaction IDs to differentiate these, similar  to the way TCP ports facilitate multiplexing connections between the same IP addresses on the Internet. 

[[_managing_tcap_using_cli]]
== Using CLI

You can manage all TCAP stack properties through the Command Line Interface by using the `tcap` command. 

[[_managing_tcap_using_gui]]
== Using GUI

The GUI will allow you to manage your TCAP configurations efficiently using a user-friendly interface.
Open a Web Browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/jss7-management-console/. Click on the 'TCAP' link in the left panel.
The main panel will display the names of all configured TCAP Management units.
To configure or view the settings of a particular TCAP Management Unit  you must click on the name of that unit.
The GUI will look similar to the figure below.
 

.GUI - TCAP Management
image::images/GUI_TCAP_Management.png[]

The first tab will display the properties of the TCAP Management unit.
These details displayed here are fetched from the XML descriptor file [path]_jboss-beans.xml_, which is  located at [path]_$JBOSS_HOME/server/profile_name/deploy/restcomm-ss7-service/META-INF_, where  [app]`profile_name` is the server profile name.
These properties can be modified here in the GUI.
To modify them you must click the pencil, change value and save.
The GUI will then display the modified values.

Name
	tcap set dialogidletimeout 

SYNOPSIS
	tcap set dialogidletimeout <dialogidletimeout> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	Sets millisecond value for dialog timeout. It specifies how long 
	dialog can be idle - not receive/send any messages.
	When a timeout occurs the method `TCListener.onDialogTimeout()` will be
	invoked. If a TCAP-User does not invoke `Dialog.keepAlive()` inside
	the method `TCListener.onDialogTimeout()`, the TCAP Dialog will be
	released.
	
PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<dialogidletimeout>	-	Timeout in milliseconds.
	
	Optional Parameters

	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed.

[[_tcap_property_previewmode]]
=== Preview Mode

You can modify the settings for the parameter 'previewmode' only when the TCAP Stack is not running.
In addition, this parameter cannot be modified through the CLI or GUI.
You will have to invoke the setter function directly from the source code.
 

If you are using the JBoss Application Server, then you can set this parameter by adding a property (as shown below) to the XML descriptor file [path]_jboss-beans.xml_, which is located at [path]_$JBOSS_HOME/server/profile_name/deploy/restcomm-ss7-service/META-INF_, where [app]`profile_name` is the server profile name. 
----

/*Add property for the parameter 'previewmode' to jboss-beans.xml file and specify true or false*/ 
<property name="previewMode">true</property>
----		 

The current settings of the parameter can be viewed in the GUI or by invoking the appropriate CLI command as described below. 

[[_tcap_property_previewmode_cli]]
==== Using CLI

You can retrieve the current settings of the parameter 'previewmode' by issuing the command `sctp get previewmode`.
However as explained above, you cannot modify the settings through the CLI. 

----

Name
	tcap get previewmode 

SYNOPSIS
	tcap get previewmode 

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to retrieve the current settings of the parameter
	'previewMode'. The 'previewMode' parameter is used for special processing 
	mode.
	
	When Preview Mode is set to true:
	- In TCAP level the stack only listens for incoming messages and
	sends nothing.
	- Methods like send(), close(), sendComponent() and other such methods
	do nothing.
	- A TCAP Dialog is temporary. The TCAP Dialog is discarded after 
	any incoming message like TC-BEGIN or TC-CONTINUE has been processed.
	- For any incoming messages (including TC-CONTINUE, TC-END, TC-ABORT) a new 
	TCAP Dialog is created (and then deleted).
	- There are no timers and timeouts.
	
	The settings of this parameter can be modified only when the TCAP Stack is
	not running. To modify this parameter you must invoke the setter function
	directly from the code or if you are using the JBoss AS, you can add a 
	property to the XML descriptor file jboss-beans.xml. You cannot change the
	settings through the CLI.
----

[[_tcap_property_previewmode_gui]]

[[_tcap_property_executordelaythreshold]]
=== Thresholds for Executors congestion control

[[_tcap_property_executordelaythreshold_cli]]
==== Using CLI

TCAP stack and lower level stacks measure delays between the time when an incoming message has come from a peer for processing and scheduled for execution and the time when the execution of the message starts. The more time this delay the more we have a congestion level at Thread executors side.

The delay thresholds when the congestion level is increased to level 1, 2 and 3 is configured by parameters executordelaythreshold_1, executordelaythreshold_2 and executordelaythreshold_3 (in seconds).

The delay thresholds when the congestion level is decreased to level 0, 1, and 2 is configured by parameters executorbacktonormaldelaythreshold_1, executorbacktonormaldelaythreshold_2 and executorbacktonormaldelaythreshold_3 (in seconds).

You can set the thresholds (in seconds) by issuing the commands `tcap set executordelaythreshold_1`, `tcap set executordelaythreshold_2`, `tcap set executordelaythreshold_3`, `tcap set executorbacktonormaldelaythreshold_1`, `tcap set executorbacktonormaldelaythreshold_2` or `tcap set executorbacktonormaldelaythreshold_3` with appropriate parameters as described below. You can verify this by issuing the commands `tcap get executordelaythreshold_1`, `tcap get executordelaythreshold_2`, `tcap get executordelaythreshold_3`, `tcap get executorbacktonormaldelaythreshold_1`, `tcap get executorbacktonormaldelaythreshold_2` or `tcap get executorbacktonormaldelaythreshold_3` which will display the value set for this property.

	tcap set executorbacktonormaldelaythreshold_3 <executorbacktonormaldelaythreshold_3> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
    For Thresholds Executors congestion control stack needs to have 3 thresholds
	- delays in seconds between the time when an incoming message has come from a peer
	and scheduled for execution and the time when the execution of the message starts
	(3 levels - 1, 2, 3). If a delay time in seconds becomes more then value for
	level 1, 2 or 3, the Executors' congestion level becomes to 1, 2 or 3.
	Default values:
	for executordelaythreshold_1 is 1 second
	for executordelaythreshold_2 is 6 seconds
	for executordelaythreshold_3 is 12 seconds
	for executorbacktonormaldelaythreshold_1 is 0.5 seconds

[[_tcap_property_memorythreshold]]
=== Thresholds for Memory congestion control

[[_tcap_property_memorythreshold_cli]]
==== Using CLI

TCAP stack and lower level stacks measure the percentage of message usage. The more memory we use the more we have a congestion level at memory resourse consuming.

The memory thresholds when the congestion level is increased to level 1, 2 and 3 is configured by parameters memorythreshold_1, memorythreshold_2 and memorythreshold_3 (in percents).

The memory thresholds when the congestion level is decreased to level 0, 1, and 2 is configured by parameters backtonormalmemorythreshold_1, backtonormalmemorythreshold_2 and backtonormalmemorythreshold_3 (in percents).

You can set the thresholds (in percents) by issuing the commands `tcap set memorythreshold_1`, `tcap set memorythreshold_2`, `tcap set memorythreshold_3`, `tcap set backtonormalmemorythreshold_1`, `tcap set backtonormalmemorythreshold_2` or `tcap set backtonormalmemorythreshold_3` with appropriate parameters as described below.
