[[_managing_sccp]]
= SCCP Management

SCCP provides connectionless and connection-oriented network services.
This includes address(GTT) translation and routing, flow control, segmentation and reassembly.
A global title is an address (e.g., a dialed 800 number, calling card number, or mobile subscriber identification number) which is translated by SCCP into a destination  point code and subsystem number.
A subsystem number uniquely identifies an application at the destination signaling point.  is used as the  transport layer for -based services.

The first step in configuring SCCP is defining service access points (sap). This step is mandatory.
Each SCCP stack can use one or more Mtp3UserPart  (Refer <<_configuring_sccp>> about Mtp3UserPart settings). A sap is a logical definition of the Mtp3UserPart [corresponding local SPC,  network indicator (NI) and a set of destinations (remote SPC list)].

The second step is the definition of a list of available remote signaling pointcodes (SPC - rsp) and  a list of available remote Sub-Systems (SNN - rss). This step is also mandatory.
If routing only by GlobalTitle is used then it is not required to configure remote Sub-Systems.

Since  acts as a message router, it is required to configure routing information.
Rules (rule), primary and backup (address) (if backup addresses are available)  addresses should be configured.
If XUDT and LUDT messages are available in the SS7 network, you should configure a set of long message rules (lmr) that will allow long messages.
This step is not mandatory.
If no long message rules are configured only UDT messages will be used.

The last step is optional.
You can configure a set of concerned signaling point codes (csp). Each point code will be announced when local SCCP user becomes unavailable.

[[_managing_sccp_using_cli]]
== Using CLI

You can manage all SCCP related configurations through the Command Line Interface by using the `sccp` command with appropriate parameters.
You can create, modify, delete  and view SCCP Service Access Points (sap) and Destinations (dest), Remote Signaling Point Codes (rsp), Remote Sub Systems (rss), Concerned Signaling Point Codes (csp),  Routing information (rules, primary and backup addresses) and Long Message Rules (lmr). You can also set and get values for general parameters using this command.

[[_managing_sccp_using_gui]]
== Using GUI

The GUI will allow you to manage your SCCP configurations efficiently using a user-friendly interface.
Open a Web Browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/jss7-management-console/.  Click on the 'SCCP' link in the left panel.
The main panel will display the names of all configured SCCP Management units.
To configure or view the settings of a particular SCCP Management  Unit you must click on the name of that unit.
The GUI will look similar to the figure below and is divided into tabs.


The first tab will display the properties of the SCCP Management unit.
These details displayed here are fetched from the XML descriptor file [path]_jboss-beans.xml_, which is  located at [path]_$JBOSS_HOME/server/profile_name/deploy/restcomm-ss7-service/META-INF_, where [app]`profile_name` is the server profile name.
These properties can be modified here in the GUI.
To modify them you must click on pencil, make changes and save.
The GUI will then display the modified values.

[[_managing_sccp_rule_create]]
== Create a new SCCP Rule

=== Sorting Algorithm

When you define Rules, a comparison function imposes ordering the collection of SCCP Rules using a sorting algorithm that is based on the GT digits.
The algorithm is defined below:

. Rules defined with OriginationType==localOriginated or OriginationType==remoteOriginated, are always at the top of the list.
  Rules defined with OriginationType==All are always at the bottom of the list.
+
Among rules with the same values for OriginationType (All or localOriginated/remoteOriginated), the sorting is done using the below rules.

. Rules with GT digits having no wildcard (* or ?) are always at the top of the list.
  Between two Rules with GT digits, both having no wildcards, the one with the shortest length is at the top of the list.
  For example, Digit1 "123456" will be above Digit2 "1234567890" and this will be above Digit3 "999/*
. Rules with GT digits having the wildcard "?" are always above digits having the wildcard "*". For example, Digit1 "800/????/9" will be above Digit2 "999/*
. Between Rules with two GT digits both having wildcard "?", the one with the least number of wildcard "?" is at the top of the list.
  For example, Digit1 "800/????/9" will be above Digit2 "800/?????/9"
. Between Rules with two GT digits both having an equal number of wildcard "?", the digit whose first appearance of "?" is after other, is at the top of the list.
  For example between Digit1 "80/??/0/???/9" and Digit 2 "800/?????/9", Digit2 is above Digit1.				When a Rule is compared during Translation, comparison always starts from the top of the list.
. If 2 rules have exactly same digits then rules are sorted using the above logic for calling digits.

Parameters backup-addressid (when ruleType parameter is "solitary"), loadsharing-algo (when ruleType parameter is not "loadshared"), newcgparty-addressid, origination-type, networkid, stackname and parameters for a calling party address (calling-ai, calling-pc, calling-ssn, calling-tt, calling-np, calling-nai, calling-digits-pattern) are optional. If newcgparty-addressid is not specified then calling party address will not be changed. If origination-type is not specified then a rule applies to
all messages regardless of their origination. If networkid is not specified then networkid will be assigned to 0. If stackname is not specified then a rule will be applied to a default SCCP stack. If calling party address parameters are not specified then only called party address patterns will be taken into account.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<id>			-	A unique number to identify this Rule.

	<mask>			-	A mask defines which part of the originally dialed
					digits remains in the translated digits and which
					part is replaced by the digits from primary or
					backup address. A mask is divided into sections by
					separator '/'. The number of sections in a mask
					should be equal to the sections in digits passed
					in this command and the sections in primary or
					backup address. This paramter is mandatory.

					MASK DEFINITIONS

					Mnemonic	Function
					----------------------------------
					- 		Ignore

					/		Separator used to split the mask
							into sections.

					K		Retain the original dialed digits
							of this section in the translated

							section from primary or backup
							address in the translated digits.

	<address-indicator>	-	The address indicator is the first field in a SCCP
					Party Address (called/calling) and is one octet in
					length. Its function is to indicate which
					information elements are present so that the
					address can be interpreted. In other words, it
					indicates the type of addressing information that

	calling-nai <calling-nature-of-address-indicator>
	calling-digits-pattern <calling-digits-pattern> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to modify the values of a SCCP Route previously defined.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<id>			-	A unique number to identify this Rule.

	Optional Parameters
	<mask>			-	A mask defines which part of the originally dialed
					digits remains in the translated digits and which
					part is replaced by the digits from primary or
					backup address. A mask is divided into sections by
					separator '/'. The number of sections in a mask
					should be equal to the sections in digits passed
					in this command and the sections in primary or
					backup address. This paramter is mandatory.

					MASK DEFINITIONS

					Mnemonic	Function
					----------------------------------
					- 		Ignore

					/		Separator used to split the mask
							into sections.

					K		Retain the original dialed digits
							of this section in the translated
							digits.

					R		Replace the original dialed digits
							of this section with the same
							section from primary or backup
							address in the translated digits.

	<address-indicator>	-	The address indicator is the first field in a SCCP
					Party Address (called/calling) and is one octet in
					length. Its function is to indicate which
					information elements are present so that the
					address can be interpreted. In other words, it
					indicates the type of addressing information that
					is to be found in the address field. The
					addressing information from the original global
					title is then compared with the passed address
					information to match the rule.

					SCCP ADDRESS INDICATOR
					--------------------------------
					| 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 |3 | 2 | 1 |
					--------------------------------

					Bit '1'     : PC Indicator
						      (1 = included)

					Bit '2'     : SSN Indicator
						      (1 = included)

					Bit '3 - 6' : GT Indicator
						      (0000 = GT not included)
						      (0001 = GT includes
							      Nature of Address)
						      (0010 = GT includes
							      Translation Type)
						      (0011 = GT includes
							      Translation Type,
							      Numbering Plan and
							      Encoding Scheme)
						      (0100 = GT includes
							      Translation Type,
							      Numbering Plan and
							      Encoding Scheme and
							      Nature of Address)

					Bit '7'     : Routing Indicator
						      (0 = Route on GT,
						      1 = Route on PC + SSN)

					Bit '8'     : Reserved for National use.

                    Only GT Indicator is used in the current implementation.
                    A Rule matches to an original address only if GT Indicator
                    from address-indicator is the same in a rule and in an
                    original address. GT Indicator for ITU-T network that is
                    mostly used is - 0100 (GT includes Translation Type,
                    Numbering Plan and Encoding Scheme and Nature of Address).
                    If you also use 0100 - use digital value for it - 16.
                    Even when SCCP stack works in ANSI mode Address Indicator
                    value for CLI and GUI must have values that we use for
                    ITU-T mode.
