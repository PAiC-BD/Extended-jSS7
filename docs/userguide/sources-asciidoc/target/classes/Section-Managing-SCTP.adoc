= SCTP Management

[[_managing_sctp_using_cli]]
== Using CLI

You can manage all SCTP related configurations through the Command Line Interface by using the `sctp` command.
You can create, destroy, start and stop SCTP Servers / Associations by issuing the `sctp` command with appropriate parameters.

[[_managing_sctp_using_gui]]
== Using GUI

The GUI will allow you to manage your SCTP Servers and Associations efficiently using a user-friendly interface.
Open a Web Browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/jss7-management-console/. Click on the 'SCTP' link in the left panel.
The main panel will display the names of all configured SCTP Management units.
To configure or view the settings of a particular SCTP Management Unit you must click on the name of that unit.
The GUI will look similar to the figure below and is divided into three tabs.

.GUI - SCTP Management
image::images/GUI_SCTP_Management.png[]

The first tab will display the properties of the SCTP Management unit.
These details displayed here are fetched from the XML descriptor file [path]_jboss-beans.xml_, which is  located at [path]_$JBOSS_HOME/server/profile_name/deploy/restcomm-ss7-service/META-INF_, where  [app]`profile_name` is the server profile name.
These properties can be modified here in the GUI.
To modify them you must click the pencil, change the value and save.
The GUI will then display the modified values.


The other two tabs will allow you to manage and monitor all Servers and Associations within this SCTP Management unit.


[[_sctp_properties]]
== SCTP stack properties

[[_sctp_property_connectdelay]]
=== Connect Delay

[[_sctp_property_connectdelay_cli]]
==== Using CLI

You can set the 'Connect Delay (milliseconds)' by issuing the command `sctp set connectdelay` with appropriate parameters as described below.
You can verify this by issuing the command `sctp get connectdelay` which will display the value set for this property.

----

Name
	sctp set connectdelay

SYNOPSIS
	sctp set connectdelay <connectdelay> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	If the SCTP Socket is client-side, connectDelay specifies
	the delay time in milliseconds after which a connection
	with the server will be attempted. This delay is necessary
	when there is network disruption and the connection between
	the client and the server breaks, so that the SCTP stack
	doesn't continuously attempt to reconnect.
	Defalut is 30000 milliseconds.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<connectdelay>	-	Connect delay in milliseconds.

	Optional Parameters

	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed.
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used.

EXAMPLES
	sctp set connectdelay 40000

[[_sctp_property_cc_delaythreshold]]
=== Thresholds for outgoing congestion control

[[_sctp_property_cc_delaythreshold_cli]]
==== Using CLI

SCTP library measures delays between the time when an outgoing message had been delivered from SS7 stack for sending and and the time when the message was sent to SCTP/TCP channel.
The more time this delay the more we have a congestion level.

The delay thresholds when the congestion level is increased to level 1, 2 and 3 is configured by parameters cc_delaythreshold_1, cc_delaythreshold_2 and cc_delaythreshold_3 (in seconds).

The delay thresholds when the congestion level is decreased to level 0, 1, and 2 is configured by parameters cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_1, cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_2 and cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_3 (in seconds).

You can set the thresholds (in milliseconds) by issuing the commands `sctp set cc_delaythreshold_1`, `sctp set cc_delaythreshold_2`, `sctp set cc_delaythreshold_3`, `sctp set cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_1`, `sctp set cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_2` or `sctp set cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_3` with appropriate parameters as described below.
You can verify this by issuing the commands `sctp get cc_delaythreshold_1`, `sctp get cc_delaythreshold_2`, `sctp get cc_delaythreshold_3`, `sctp get cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_1`, `sctp get cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_2` or `sctp get cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_3`  which will display the value set for this property.

Name
	sctp set cc_delaythreshold_1
	sctp set cc_delaythreshold_2
	sctp set cc_delaythreshold_3
	sctp set cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_1
	sctp set cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_2
	sctp set cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_3

SYNOPSIS
	sctp set cc_delaythreshold_1 <threshold> stackname <stack-name>
	sctp set cc_delaythreshold_2 <threshold> stackname <stack-name>
	sctp set cc_delaythreshold_3 <threshold> stackname <stack-name>
	sctp set cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_1 <threshold> stackname <stack-name>
	sctp set cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_2 <threshold> stackname <stack-name>
	sctp set cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_3 <threshold> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	For outgoing messages congestion control stack needs to have 3 thresholds
	- delays of outgoing messages before it will be sent to IP channel (3
	levels - 1, 2, 3). If a delay time in seconds becomes more then value for
	level 1, 2 or 3, the Association's congestion level becomes to 1, 2 or 3.
	Default values:
	for cc_delaythreshold_1 is 2.5 seconds.
	for cc_delaythreshold_2 is 8   seconds.
	for cc_delaythreshold_3 is 14 seconds.
	for cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_1 is 1.5 seconds.
	for cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_2 is 5.5 seconds.
	for cc_backtonormal_delaythreshold_3 is 10  seconds.

PARAMETERS

	Optional Parameters

	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed.
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used.

EXAMPLES
	sctp set cc_delaythreshold_1 2.5
	sctp set cc_delaythreshold_2 8

					and you should not pass this parameter.

	Optional Parameters

	<socket-type>	-	If you do not specify the socket-type as "TCP",
					by default it will be SCTP. If it is a
					SERVER SCTP Association, the socket-type must
					match with the one specified while creating the
