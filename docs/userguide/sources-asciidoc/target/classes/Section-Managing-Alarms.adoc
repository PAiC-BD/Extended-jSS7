= Alarms

The GUI will allow you to view the Alarms (Critical, Major, Minor, Warning) in the system and filter them based on the severity.
Open a Web Browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/jss7-management-console/. Click on the 'Alarms' link in the left panel.
The main panel will display all the currently raised alarms.
You can filter the view by using the checkboxes at the top to select/deselect the severity options and accordingly filter the display.

You will notice that as soon as the problem is resolved, the corresponding alarm will disappear from the view.
In future releases, there will be an option to persist this alarms data and hence you will be able to view a history of alarms raised and resolved.
But as of now, only currently active alarms will be displayed in this window.
