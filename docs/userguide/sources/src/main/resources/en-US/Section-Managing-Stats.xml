		<note>
			<para>
				&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; doesn't persist the statistics, hence the data collected for campaign period refresh's every defined 'Duration'. User must refresh the page every 'Duration' 
				period to gather statistics data for previous time period.
			</para>
			<para>
				Nevertheless you can also click on 'Metrics' link on left panel, select the Campaign and observe the statistics graph. The metrics page gathers data from time page was loaded till user navigates 
				away. Hence graph will show historic data from point page was loaded.

			The GUI will allow you to view stats in real time. But the stats are not stored in the Database for you to analyse at a later point of time. However &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; gives you an option to have the stats logged every refresh period for all the existing campaigns. You can look at the log files at any point of time for analysing or understanding the performance.

		If you wish to have stats logged, you must configure the settings in the file <filename>jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/default/conf/jboss-log4j.xml</filename>. If you are running the platform as standalone, then you should configure in <filename>log4j.xml</filename>.
