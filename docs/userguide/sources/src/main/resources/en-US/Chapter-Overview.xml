		<title>Time Division Multiplexing</title>
		<para>
			In circuit switched networks such as the Public Switched Telephone
			Network (<acronym>PSTN</acronym>) there exists the need to transmit multiple
			subscribers’ calls along the same transmission medium. To accomplish
			this, network designers make use of Time Division Multiplexing<acronym>TDM</acronym>. <acronym>TDM</acronym> allows switches to
			create channels, also known as tributaries, within a transmission
			stream. A standard DS0 voice signal has a data bit rate of 64 kbit/s,
			determined using Nyquist’s sampling criterion. <acronym>TDM</acronym> takes frames of
			the voice signals and multiplexes them into a <acronym>TDM</acronym> frame which runs at
			a higher bandwidth. So if the <acronym>TDM</acronym> frame consists of 'n' voice frames,
			the bandwidth will be n*64 kbit/s.
			Each voice sample timeslot in the <acronym>TDM</acronym> frame is called a channel . In
			European systems, <acronym>TDM</acronym> frames contain 30 digital voice channels, and
			in American systems, they contain 24 channels. Both standards also
			contain extra bits (or bit timeslots) for signaling (SS7) and
			synchronisation bits.
			Multiplexing more than 24 or 30 digital voice channels is called higher order
			multiplexing. Higher order multiplexing is accomplished by
			multiplexing the standard <acronym>TDM</acronym> frames.For example, a European 120
			channel <acronym>TDM</acronym> frame is formed by multiplexing four standard 30 channel
			<acronym>TDM</acronym> frames.At each higher order multiplex, four <acronym>TDM</acronym> frames from the
			immediate lower order are combined, creating multiplexes with a
			bandwidth of n x 64 kbit/s, where n = 120, 480, 1920, etc.
