&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; is the only Open Source Java based implementation of the SS7 protocol stack. It provides implementation for <literal>MTP2</literal>, <literal>MTP3</literal>, <literal>ISUP</literal>, <literal>SCCP</literal>, <literal>TCAP</literal>, <literal>CAMEL (Phase I, Phase II, Phase III and Phase IV)</literal> and <literal>MAP</literal> protocols
for a dedicated equipment. It also has in-built support for <literal>SIGTRAN (M3UA)</literal> over IP and strictly adheres to the standards and specifications defined by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The platform offers developers with a flexible API set that hides the lower layer details (legacy SS7 links or SIGTRAN) and therefore makes it simple and easy to develop SS7 applications as well as to migrate your applications from TDM equipments to M3UA. &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; is based on an easily scalable and configurable load-balancing architecture.
		</para>

<para>
&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; supports TDM hardware offered by major vendors in the market, namely Intel family boards (Dialogic) and 
Zaptel/Dahdi (Digium, Sangoma).   
		</para>
		<para> 
If you intend to use only <literal>M3UA</literal> you can install the &THIS.APPLICATION; on any Operating System that supports Java. However if you wish to use SS7 cards, the native libaries for these are only compiled for Linux at the moment. &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; can work as a standalone library. However if you wish to use JSLEE Resource Adapters, the Command Line Interface (Shell Management tool) or the GUI Management Console for run-time configuration, then you must have JBoss Application Server installed and running. &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; comes with JSLEE TCAP, MAP, CAP and ISUP Resource Adaptors (RA) that enable developers to build SS7 
applications with ease. Developers only require an understanding of Resource Adaptors and can focus on building applications quickly and efficiently rather than worry about the SS7 stack.

This guide provides details on configuring and using the platform and information regarding the supported protocols and compliant standards. For installation instructions, please refer to the Installation Guide published along with this.

	  <title>About SS7</title>
	  <para>
    	SS7 (Signaling System No.7) is a set of signaling protocols defined for information exchange in telephony. It is the global standard for telecommunications and is defined by the <ulink url="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/ITU">International Telecommunication Union (ITU) - Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)</ulink>. It is also commonly referred to as Common Channel Signaling System No. 7 (i.e., <acronym>SS7</acronym> or <acronym>C7</acronym>).
		</para>
		<para>
		In telephony (wireless and wireline), the information associated with a call must be exchanged between a telephone and the telephone exchange or between exchanges, transit nodes and other elements in the network. Information exchange is required to set up, control and tear down calls and this exchange of information is called Signaling. SS7 is the global standard that defines the procedures and protocol to be followed by network elements in the Public Switched Telephone Network (<acronym>PSTN</acronym>) in order to exchange information over a digital signaling network to effect wireless (cellular) and wireline call setup, route,control, monitor and terminate. 
		</para>
	<para>
		The
		ITU definition of SS7 allows for national variants such as the
		American National Standards Institute (<acronym>ANSI</acronym>) and Bell Communications
		Research (Telcordia Technologies) standards used in North America and
		the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (
		<ulink url="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/ETSI">ETSI</ulink>
		) standard
		used in Europe.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		The hardware and software functions of the <acronym>SS7</acronym> protocol are divided
		into
		functional abstractions called "levels". These levels map loosely
		to
		the Open Systems Interconnect (<acronym>OSI</acronym>) 7-layer model defined by the
		<ulink url="http://www.iso.ch/">International Standards Organization (ISO)</ulink>.

		&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; is a software based implementation of the SS7 protocol. It provides implementation for Level 2 and above in the SS7 protocol Stack. 
		The &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; is a platform in the sense that it does not provide the application itself but rather allows users to build their own SS7 applications using &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; as a platform.
