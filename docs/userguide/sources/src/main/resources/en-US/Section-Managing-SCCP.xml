		<title>SCCP Management</title>

		<para>
			SCCP provides connectionless and connection-oriented network services. This includes address(GTT) translation and routing, flow control, segmentation and reassembly.
			A global title is an address (e.g., a dialed 800 number, calling card number, or mobile subscriber identification number) which is translated by SCCP into a destination
			point code and subsystem number. A subsystem number uniquely identifies an application at the destination signaling point. <acronym>SCCP</acronym> is used as the
			transport layer for <acronym>TCAP</acronym>-based services.
		</para>
		<para>
			The first step in configuring SCCP is defining service access points (sap). This step is mandatory. Each SCCP stack can use one or more Mtp3UserPart
			(Refer <xref linkend="configuring_SCCP"/> about Mtp3UserPart settings). A sap is a logical definition of the Mtp3UserPart [corresponding local SPC,
			network indicator (NI) and a set of destinations (remote SPC list)].
		</para>
		<para>
			The second step is the definition of a list of available remote signaling pointcodes (SPC - rsp) and
			a list of available remote Sub-Systems (SNN - rss). This step is also mandatory. If routing only by GlobalTitle is used then it is not required to configure remote Sub-Systems.
		</para>
		<para>
			Since <acronym>SCCP</acronym> acts as a message router, it is required to configure routing information. Rules (rule), primary and backup (address) (if backup addresses are available)
			addresses should be configured. If XUDT and LUDT messages are available in the SS7 network, you should configure a set of long message rules (lmr) that will allow long messages.
			This step is not mandatory. If no long message rules are configured only UDT messages will be used.
		</para>
		<para>
			The last step is optional. You can configure a set of concerned signaling point codes (csp). Each point code will be announced when local SCCP user becomes unavailable.

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to define a new Destination for a Service Access Point.
	For every SAP in the system, you should configure one or more Destinations.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<sap-id>	-	The identifier of the SAP for which this new Destination
				is being defined. You must ensure that the SAP has been
				created prior to issuing this command.

	<id>		-	An identifier for this newly created Destination.
				The number must be unique within each SAP.

	<first-dpc>	-	The first value of the remote signaling point codes range.

	<last-dpc>	-	The last value of the remote signaling point codes range.
				If the Destination specifies only a single Signaling
				Point Code, this value must be equal to the value
				specified for 'first-dpc'.

	<first-sls>	-	The first value of the SLS range.
				SLS value range is from 0 to 255.

	<last-sls>	-	The last value of the SLS range.

	<sls-mask>	-	The mask value. SLS of a message will be exposed by
				performing a bitwise AND operation with this mask prior to
				comparing it with first-sls and last-sls values.

	Optional Parameters

	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed.
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used.


EXAMPLES

SYNOPSIS
	sccp address create <id> <address-indicator> <point-code> <subsystem-number>
	<translation-type> <numbering-plan> <nature-of-address-indicator> <digits>
	stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to create a new primary address or backup address of
	translation. You can create a new newCallingParty address as well
	using this command. The global title address information of this command is combined with
	the global title being translated by examining the mask provided in the
	'sccp rule create' command.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<id>			-	A unique number to identify this address.

	<address-indicator>	-	The address indicator is the first field in a SCCP
					Party Address (called/calling) and is one octet in
					length. Its function is to indicate which
					information elements are present so that the
					address can be interpreted. In other words, it
					indicates the type of addressing information that
					is to be found in the address field. The
					addressing information from the original global
					title is then compared with the passed address
					information to match the rule.

					SCCP ADDRESS INDICATOR
					--------------------------------
					| 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 |3 | 2 | 1 |
					--------------------------------

					Bit '1'     : PC Indicator
						      (1 = included)

					Bit '2'     : SSN Indicator
						      (1 = included)

					Bit '3 - 6' : GT Indicator
						      (0000 = GT not included)
						      (0001 = GT includes
							      Nature of Address)
						      (0010 = GT includes
							      Translation Type)
						      (0011 = GT includes
							      Translation Type,
							      Numbering Plan and
							      Encoding Scheme)
						      (0100 = GT includes
							      Translation Type,
							      Numbering Plan and
							      Encoding Scheme and
							      Nature of Address)

					Bit '7'     : Routing Indicator
						      (0 = Route on GT,
						      1 = Route on PC + SSN)

					Bit '8'     : Reserved for National use.

					Only two fields of Address Indicator is used now for GTT:
                    - GT Indicator (this is used for GlobalTitle type that
                      will be created)
                    - Routing Indicator bit (0 = Route on GT, 1 = Route on
                      PC + SSN)
                    GT Indicator for ITU-T network that is mostly used is -
                    0100 (GT includes Translation Type, Numbering Plan and
                    Encoding Scheme and Nature of Address). Digital value
                    for it is - 16.
                    For 0100 GT Indicator we will use two possible values:
                    16 - 0100 GT Indicator and Route on GT
                    80 - 0100 GT Indicator and Route on PC + SSN
                    Even when SCCP stack works in ANSI mode Address Indicator
                    value for CLI and GUI must have values that we use for
                    ITU-T mode.

	<point-code>		-	MTP Signaling Point Code.
					This parameter contains a point code to which message will
					be routed after GTT (DPC field).
					This parameter is mandatory.

	<subsystem-number>	- This parameter contains SSN which will be placed
	                into CalledPartyAddress. If you set this parameter to "0",
	                SSN from CalledPartyAddress of an original message will be
	                put into CalledPartyAddress.

	<translation-type>	-	This is ignored if GT Indicator is 0000 or 0001.

					TRANSLATION TYPE VALUES

					Value		Description
					----------------------------------
					0		Unknown

					1  - 63		International Service

					64 - 127	Spare

					128 - 254	National Network Specific

					255		Reserved for Expansion

					Value of this parameter will be placed into
					CalledPartyAddress. This parameter is mandatory if GT
					Indicator suppose this parameter is included into GT.
					Most used value: 0 - translation-type - Unknown

	<numbering-plan>	-	The Number Plan (NP) field specifies the numbering
					plan which the address information follows. This
					is ignored if GT Indicator is 0000, 0001 or 0010.

                    Value of this parameter will be placed into
                    CalledPartyAddress. This parameter is mandatory if GT
                    Indicator suppose this parameter is included into GT.
                    Most used value: 1 - numbering-plan - ISDN/telephony

	<nature-of-address>	-	The Nature of Address Indicator (NAI) field
					defines the address range for a specific numbering
					plan. This is only used if GT Indicator is 0100.

                    Value of this parameter will be placed into
                    CalledPartyAddress. This parameter is mandatory if GT
                    Indicator suppose this parameter is included into GT.
                    Most used value: 4 - nature-of-address - International

	<digits>		-	The global title address information to translate
					to. Specified as string of digits divided into
					subsections using separator '/' depending on if
					the mask contains separator or not.
					The digits string can contain:

					DIGIT PATTERN

					Value		Description
					----------------------------------
					-		padding - ignored

					/		separator used to split the digit
							pattern into sections.
							Each section is processed
							differently as specified by the
							mask parameter in the
							'sccp rule create' command.

                    We need this parameter if at least one section of Rule
                    mask contains "R" (replace) value. Else set this field
                    to "0". If this field is needed it should contain the
                    same subsections as the rule mask has.

	Optional Parameters

	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed.
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used.

SYNOPSIS
	sccp rule create <id> <mask> <address-indicator> <point-code> <subsystem-number>
	<translation-type> <numbering-plan> <nature-of-address-indicator> <digits>
	<ruleType> <primary-address-id> backup-addressid <backup-address-id>

	<new-callingPartyAddress-id> origination-type <originationType>
	stackname <stack-name> networkid <networkId>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to create a new SCCP Routing Rule. You must ensure that
	primary and backup addresses are configured properly prior to executing this
	command.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<id>			-	A unique number to identify this Rule.

	<mask>			-	A mask defines which part of the originally dialed
					digits remains in the translated digits and which
					part is replaced by the digits from primary or
					backup address. A mask is divided into sections by
					separator '/'. The number of sections in a mask
					should be equal to the sections in digits passed
					in this command and the sections in primary or
					backup address. This paramter is mandatory.

					MASK DEFINITIONS

					Mnemonic	Function
					----------------------------------
					- 		Ignore

					/		Separator used to split the mask
							into sections.

					K		Retain the original dialed digits
							of this section in the translated
							digits.

					R		Replace the original dialed digits
							of this section with the same
							section from primary or backup
							address in the translated digits.

	<address-indicator>	-	The address indicator is the first field in a SCCP
					Party Address (called/calling) and is one octet in
					length. Its function is to indicate which
					information elements are present so that the
					address can be interpreted. In other words, it
					indicates the type of addressing information that
					is to be found in the address field. The
					addressing information from the original global
					title is then compared with the passed address
					information to match the rule.

					SCCP ADDRESS INDICATOR

						      (0100 = GT includes
							      Translation Type,
							      Numbering Plan and
							      Encoding Scheme and
							      Nature of Address)

					Bit '7'     : Routing Indicator
						      (0 = Route on GT,
						      1 = Route on PC + SSN)

					Bit '8'     : Reserved for National use.

					Only GT Indicator is used in the current implementation.
					A Rule matches to an original address only if GT Indicator
					from address-indicator is the same in a rule and in an
					original address. GT Indicator for ITU-T network that is
					mostly used is - 0100 (GT includes Translation Type,
					Numbering Plan and Encoding Scheme and Nature of Address).
					If you also use 0100 - use digital value for it - 16.
                    Even when SCCP stack works in ANSI mode Address Indicator
                    value for CLI and GUI must have values that we use for
                    ITU-T mode.

	<point-code>		-	MTP Signaling Point Code. This is ignored if
					Bit '0' of address-indicator is not set.
					This parameter is not used in currentimplemetation and
					can be set to "0".

	<subsystem-number>	-	This is ignored if Bit '1' of address-indicator is
					not set.
                    This parameter is not used in currentimplemetation and

					ORIGINATION TYPE VALUES

					Value			Description
					-------------------------------------
					localOriginated		If this parameter is
								"localOriginated", then a
								rule applies only for
								messages originating from
								local SCCP users
								(for example a local
								TCAP stack).

					remoteOriginated	If this parameter is
								"remoteOriginated", then a
								rule applies only for
								messages originating from
								SS7 network and not for
								messages originating from
								local SCCP users.

	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed.
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used.

    <networkId>     - A digital parameter that means to which virtual SS7 network
                    belongs a Rule. If this parameter is skipped - networkId will
                    be set to "0" when a Rule creation.
