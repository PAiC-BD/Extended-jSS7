		<title>Running SS7 Simulator remotely

	<para>
		The Simulator can be run remotely using RMI and/or HTML Adaptors. But prior to launching the Simulator remotely, you must first run a tester host in the host machine as explained in the procedure below: 
	</para>
	<procedure>
		<title>Launching a Tester Host in the host machine</title>
		<step><para>Pre-requisite: You must have SS7 Simulator installed locally in the host machine.</para></step>	
				<step>
						<para>
							Change the working directory to the bin folder in the Simulator's installation
							directory.

						<screen>downloads]$ cd restcomm-jss7-&lt;version&gt;/ss7/restcomm-ss7-simulator/bin</screen>

						<para>
							Execute the
							<filename>run.sh</filename>
							Bourne shell script with the command <literal>./run.sh core -na1 -t8001 -r9999,9998</literal> or <literal>./run.sh core --name=a1 --http=8001 --rmi=9999,9998</literal>. You can use a <literal>rmi</literal> connector or <literal>http</literal> connector or both simultaneously. The command options are explained below:
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>"-n" (or "--name=") defines a host name (in the example above: "a1").</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>"-r" (or "--rmi=") defines a port's listening for rmi requests (in the example above: "9999 and 9998"). RMI protocol uses 2 ports for server access. The first port (9999 above) is rmi port and 9998 
		is second port used by RMI. Usually RMI randomly selects this 2nd port, however if the core simulator is behind firewall, 
		the GUI will not be able to connect from remote machine without admin opening up all the ports. This can be risky, hence --rmi takes two ports as comma separated and admin can open these two ports on firewall.</para>
		<note>
			<para>
				Please note that fixing the 2nd port in RMI contradicts the RMI specification.
			</para>
		</note>

		</listitem>
        <listitem><para>"-t" (or "--http=") defines a port listening for html requests (in the example above: "8001").</para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>"-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=192.168.1.1" - if remote host contains several IP addresses you need to specify by this command which exactly IP address RMI will use.</para></listitem>

<para>When the Tester Host is running successfully in the host machine, you can now run the Simulator tests remotely from any machine which has the Simulator installed. The following procedures provide instructions to run the Simulator remotely using the two interfaces (RMI and HTML).</para>

		<title>Managing the Simulator Remotely using RMI Interface</title>
		<step><para>Pre-Requisite: The Tester Host must be launched in the host machine as explained in the above procedure. The local machine must have the Simulator installed.</para></step>
		<step><para>The best client for managing the Simulator via a RMI interface is the GUI interface of Simulator.
		It can be launched in the same way as launching a Simulator locally: 
		<screen>
		./run.sh gui
		</screen>This will launch the GUI form "Connecting to a testerHost...".

		<step><para>In the form, select the option "Connect to the existing testerHost via JMX".</para></step>
		<step><para>In the default RMI connection string, replace "localhost" with the correct IP address of the tester host computer
		and the value "9999" with the correct RMI port (the port from option "-r" or "--rmi=" as provided when launching the testerHost in the host machine).
		</para></step>
		<step><para>
		Once successfully connected, the management will be similar to the procedures explained for running the Simulator application locally (see <xref linkend="simulator_configuring_locally" />).
	"Jconsole" application can be also used as the client. But this application is less convenient when compared to the easy RMI interface.  </para>
</step>
	</procedure>
	<procedure>
		<title>Managing the Simulator Remotely using HTML Interface</title>
		<step>
<para>
		HTML management is less convenient than RMI management. But it can be used if RMI is not acceptable (for example if you are behind a proxy). For configuring the parameters and running the tests you can use any HTML browser. In the URL field of the browser, type "http://&lt;IP address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;" where IP address is the host machine's address and port is the value specified for "-t" or "--http=" option when launching the Tester Host in the remote machine.
