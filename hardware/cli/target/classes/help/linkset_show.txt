SYNOPSIS
	linkset show

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to view all Links and Linksets and their states. 

	The possible states of a Linkset are:

	- UNAVAILABLE	:	Indicates that the Linkset does not have any 'available' 
				links and cannot transport traffic.

	- SHUTDOWN	:	Indicates that Linkset has been shutdown.

	- AVAILABLE	:	Indicates that the Linkset has atleast one 'available' 
				link and can transport traffic.

	The possible states of a Link are:

	- UNAVAILABLE	:	Indicates that the Link is not 'available' to transport
				traffic. A Link is 'unavailable' if the Link is remotely 
				or locally inhibited by a user. It can also be 
				'unavailable' if MTP2 has not been able to successfully 
				activate the link connection.

	- SHUTDOWN	:	Indicates the Link has been shutdown in the configuration. 

	- AVAILABLE	:	Indicates the Link is active and 'available' to transport 
				traffic.

	- FAILED	:	Indicates that the Link is not 'shutdown' but is 
				'unavailable' at Layer 2 for some reason. For example, the
				Initial Alignment may fail, or the link test messages sent
				by MTP 3 are not being acknowledged.
