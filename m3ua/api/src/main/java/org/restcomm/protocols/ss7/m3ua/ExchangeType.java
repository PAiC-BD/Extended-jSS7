/**
 * <p>
 * Two modes of handshake is defined
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Single Exchange (SE) model : Only a single exchange of ASP Traffic Maintenance (ASPTM) Messages and ASP State Maintenance
 * (ASPSM) Messages is needed to change the {@link As} states. This means that a set of requests from one end and
 * acknowledgements from the other will be enough.</li>
 * <li>
 * Double Exchange (DE) model : A double exchange of ASPTM and ASPSM messages is normally needed. When using double exchanges
 * for ASPSM messages, the management of the connection in the two directions is considered independent. This means that
 * connections from As-A to As-B is handled independently of connections from As-B to As-A. Therefore, it could happen that only
 * one of the two directions is activated or closed, while the other remains in the same state as it was.</li>
