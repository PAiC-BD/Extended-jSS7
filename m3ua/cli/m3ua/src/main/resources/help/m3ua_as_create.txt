Name
	m3ua as create

SYNOPSIS
	m3ua as create <as-name> <AS | SGW | IPSP> mode <SE | DE> 
	ipspType <client | server> rc <routing- context> traffic-mode <traffic mode> 
	min-asp <minimum asp active for TrafficModeType.Loadshare>
	network-appearance <network appearance value> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to create a new Application Server. 

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<as-name>		-	Name of the new Server created. This must be 
					unique and takes any String value.

	<AS | SGW | IPSP>	-	The type of the new Server is specified using this
					parameter. The three possible values are 
					AS (Application Server), SGW (Signaling Gateway) 
					and IPSP.

	<SE | DE>		-	You must specify if Single Exchange or 
					Double Exchange of ASPSM (ASP State Maintenance)
					and ASPTM (ASP Traffic Maintenance) messages 
					should be performed. 

	<client | server>	-	This is required if the newly created AS is of
					type IPSP. You must specify is if it is of type 
					Client or Server. 

	Optional Parameters
	
	<routing-context>	-	This refers to the Routing Context configured for 
					M3UA Stack on SGW. This parameter is optional. 

					However for an ASP (Application Server Process) 
					assigned to this AS to be configured to process 
					signaling traffic related to more than one AS over
					a single SCTP Association, it is mandatory to 
					specify a routing-context for the AS. If an ASP is
					configured to always process signaling traffic 
					from one AS, irrespective of whether the received
					messages have routing context set or not, it will 
					always be delivered to AS for further processing. 

					However if an ASP is configured to process 
					signaling traffic related to more than one AS over
					a single SCTP Association and if a signaling 
					message is received without RC, then the ASP will 
					drop the message and send back an Error message.
					A respective log4j error will also be logged.

	<traffic-mode>		-	You may choose to specify the traffic mode for 
					ASPs. At the moment jSS7 M3UA supports only 
					2 modes: loadshare and override. Broadcast mode is
					not supported. 

					This is an optional parameter and if not specified
					the default mode is 'loadshare'.
					
	<min-asp>			-	You may choose to specify the minumum asp 
					active for traffic mode 'loadshare' before the  
					payload starts flowing.

					This is an optional parameter and if not specified
					the default value is 1. Also if traffic-mode is not 	
					'loadshare' setting this value has no effect.				
	
	<network-appearance>	-	This is a M3UA local reference (typically an 
					integer) shared by SG and AS. This value together 
					with a Signaling Point Code, uniquely identifies a
					SS7 node by indicating the specific SS7 network to
					which it belongs. It can be used to distinguish 
					between signalling traffic, associated with 
					different networks, being sent between the SG and 
					the ASP over a common SCTP association. 
					
	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed. 
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used. 					

EXAMPLES
	m3ua as create AS1 IPSP mode DE ipspType server rc 1 traffic-mode loadshare 

	The above command will create a new M3UA Application Server identified as AS1, 
	of type IPSP (Server), Double Exchange mode. The Routing Context is 1 and 
	traffic-mode is 'loadshare'.  

	m3ua as create AS2 AS mode SE rc 100 traffic-mode loadshare 2 network-appearance 12 
	
	The above command will create a new M3UA Application Server identified as AS2, 
	of type AS, Single Exchange mode. The Routing Context is 100, 
	traffic-mode is 'loadshare' and minimun asp to be active for payload transfer is 2. 
	The network-appearance value is 12.
