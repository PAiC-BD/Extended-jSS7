Name
	sctp set connectdelay 

SYNOPSIS
	sctp set connectdelay <connectdelay> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	If the SCTP Socket is client-side, connectDelay specifies 
	the delay time in milliseconds after which a connection 
	with the server will be attempted. This delay is necessary 
	when there is network disruption and the connection between 
	the client and the server breaks, so that the SCTP stack 
	doesn't continuously attempt to reconnect. 
	Default is 30000 milliseconds.
	
PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<connectdelay>	-	Connect delay in milliseconds.
	
	Optional Parameters

	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed. 
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used.	

EXAMPLES
	sctp set connectdelay 40000
