SYNOPSIS
	sctp association modify <assoc-name> <stack-name> <CLIENT | SERVER> servername <server-name> 
	peerhost <peer-ip> peerport <peer-port> host <host-ip> port <host-port> sockettype <socket-type>
	extraaddresses <extra-host-addresses>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to modify a existed SCTP (Client side or Server side) 
	association. 

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<assoc-name>	-	Name of the existed Association which will be modified.
					
	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed. 					
					

	<CLIENT | SERVER>	-	Specify if this association is client side or 
					server side.
					
	Optional Parameters

	<peer-ip>		-	In a client side association, the server IP 
					address to which the client is connecting to.

					In a server side association, the client IP 
					address from which connections will be accepted.
	
	<peer-port>		-	In a client side association, the server Port 
					to which the client is connecting to.

					In a server side association, the client port from 
					which connections will be accepted.

	<host-ip>		-	In a client side association, the local IP address
					to which the socket will bind to. 
			
	<host-port>		-	In a client side association, the local port to
					which the socket will bind to. This is 
					required only for a client side Association.
					
					For a server side association, even if you specify
					these values it will be ignored.

	<server-name>	-	In a server-side association, the server-name. 

					In a client-side association, this is not required 
					and you should not pass this parameter.

	<socket-type>	-	socket-type "TCP"/"SCTP". If it is a
					SERVER SCTP Association, the socket-type must 
					match with the one specified while creating the
					Server.
					
	<extra-host-addresses> - For SCTP multi-home support, you can pass multiple
					IP addresses as comma separated values. The 
					Association will bind to the primary IP address 
					and when it becomes unavailable, it will 
					automatically fall back to secondary address. 
					If the socket-type is TCP, these comma separated 
					values will be ignored and the Assocation will 
					always bind to the primary IP address (host). This is 
					required only for a client side Association. 
					
					For a server side association, even if you specify
					these values it will be ignored.
		
						

EXAMPLES
	sctp association modify Assoc1 sctpManagement1 CLIENT port 2476
	
	The above command will modify a CLIENT SCTP Association identified as Assoc1
	which belongs to SCTP management with name sctpManagement1. 
	
	If an Association is connected stack will drop the connection firstly. 
	Then the Association will reconnect itself.
