SYNOPSIS
	sctp server modify <sever-name> <stack-name> host <host-ip> port <host-port> sockettype <socket-type>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to modify a existed SCTP Server (or TCP Server) instance. 

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<server-name>	-	Name of the Server which will be modified.
					
	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed.
	
	Optional Parameters 

	<host-ip>		-	The host IP address to which the SCTP Server 
					socket will bind to.
	
	<host-port>		-	The host port to which the underlying SCTP Server 
					socket will bind to.
					
	<socket-type>	-	Socket-type "TCP"/"SCTP".
					
	<extra-host-addresses>	-	For SCTP multi-home support, you can pass multiple
					IP addresses as comma separated values. The Server
					socket will bind to the primary IP address and 
					when it becomes unavailable, it will automatically
					fall back to secondary address. If the socket-type 
					is TCP, these comma separated values will be 
					ignored and the Server socket will always bind to
					the primary IP address (host-ip).
					
	<accept-anonymous-connections>	-	will server check ip and port of the CLient
										true/false
	
	<max-concurrent-connections-count>	-	set max concurrent connections

EXAMPLES
	sctp server modify TestServer sctpManagement1 port 2905
	
	The above command will modify a new SCTP Server identified as TestServer 
	which belongs to SCTP management with name sctpManagement1 and modified 
	the Server socket to the port 2905. Server MUST be stopped.
