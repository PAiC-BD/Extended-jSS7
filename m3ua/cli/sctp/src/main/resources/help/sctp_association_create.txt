Name
	sctp association create

SYNOPSIS
	sctp association create <assoc-name> <CLIENT | SERVER> <server-name> <peer-ip> 
	<peer-port> <host- ip> <host-port> <socket-type> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to create a new SCTP (Client side or Server side) 
	association. 

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<assoc-name>		-	Name of the new Association created. This must be 
					unique and takes any String value.

	<CLIENT | SERVER>	-	Specify if this association is client side or 
					server side. If it is client side, it will 
					initiate the connection to peer. If it is server 
					side, it will wait for peer to initiate the
					connection. The connection request will be 
					accepted from peer-ip: peer:port.

	<peer-ip>		-	In a client side association, the server IP 
					address to which the client is connecting to.

					In a server side association, the client IP 
					address from which connections will be accepted.
	
	<peer-port>		-	In a client side association, the server Port 
					to which the client is connecting to.

					In a server side association, the client port from 
					which connections will be accepted.

	<host-ip>		-	In a client side association, the local IP address
					to which the socket will bind to. 
			
					For SCTP multi-home support, you can pass multiple
					IP addresses as comma separated values. The 
					Association will bind to the primary IP address 
					and when it becomes unavailable, it will 
					automatically fall back to secondary address. 
					If the socket-type is TCP, these comma separated 
					values will be ignored and the Assocation will 
					always bind to the primary IP address (the first
					value in the comma separated list). This is 
					required only for a client side Association. 
					
					For a server side association, even if you specify
					these values it will be ignored.
	
	<host-port>		-	In a client side association, the local port to
					which the socket will bind to. This is 
					required only for a client side Association.
					
					For a server side association, even if you specify
					these values it will be ignored.

	<server-name>	-	In a server-side association, the server-name must
					be passed to associate with the Server identified 
					by that name. You must ensure that the Server 
					identified by server-name has already been created 
					using the sctp server create command. 

					In a client-side association, this is not required 
					and you should not pass this parameter.

	Optional Parameters
	
	<socket-type>	-	If you do not specify the socket-type as "TCP", 
					by default it will be SCTP. If it is a
					SERVER SCTP Association, the socket-type must 
					match with the one specified while creating the
					Server.
						
	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed. 
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used. 					

EXAMPLES
	sctp association create Assoc1 CLIENT 
	192.168.56.101 2905 192.168.56.1,192.168.56.1 2905
	
	The above command will create a new CLIENT SCTP Association identified as Assoc1. 
	The client side will initiate the connection. It will bind the 
	host-ip 192.168.56.1 and host-port 2905 to the Server IP 192.168.56.101 and 
	port 2905.

	sctp association create Assoc2 SERVER TestServer 192.168.56.1 2905

	The above command will create a new SERVER SCTP association with the Server 
	identified as TestServer and accept connections from peer whose IP address is
	192.168.56.1 and port 2905.
