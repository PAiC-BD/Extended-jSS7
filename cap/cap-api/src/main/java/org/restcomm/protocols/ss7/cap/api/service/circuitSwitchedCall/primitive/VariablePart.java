-- Indicates the variable part of the message. Time is BCD encoded.
-- The most significant hours digit occupies bits 0-3 of the first octet, and the least

-- occupies bits 0-3 of the second octet, and the least significant digit occupies bits 4-7
-- of the second octet.
--
-- Date is BCD encoded. The year digit indicating millenium occupies bits 0-3 of the first octet,
-- and the year digit indicating century occupies bits 4-7 of the first octet. The year digit
-- indicating decade occupies bits 0-3 of the second octet, whilst the digit indicating the year
-- within the decade occupies bits 4-7 of the second octet.
-- The most significant month digit occupies bits 0-3 of the third octet, and the least
-- significant month digit occupies bits 4-7 of the third octet. The most significant day digit
-- occupies bits 0-3 of the fourth octet, and the least significant day digit occupies bits 4-7
-- of the fourth octet.
-- Price is BCD encoded. The digit indicating hundreds of thousands occupies bits 0-3 of the
-- first octet, and the digit indicating tens of thousands occupies bits 4-7 of the first octet.
-- The digit indicating thousands occupies bits 0-3 of the second octet, whilst the digit
-- indicating hundreds occupies bits 4-7 of the second octet. The digit indicating tens occupies
-- bits 0-3 of the third octet, and the digit indicating 0 to 9 occupies bits 4-7 of the third
-- octet. The tenths digit occupies bits 0-3 of the fourth octet, and the hundredths digit
-- occupies bits 4-7 of the fourth octet.
