IPSSPCapabilities {PARAMETERS-BOUND : bound} ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE( bound.&minIPSSPCapabilitiesLength ..bound.&maxIPSSPCapabilitiesLength)) (SIZE = 1..4)
-- Indicates the gsmSRF resources available. The parameter has two parts, a standard and a
-- bilateral part. The standard part indicates capabilities defined as optional in CAP
-- that shall be recognised (but not necessarily supported) by a gsmSCF. The bilateral
-- part contains further information that is not specified in this standard, but which is set
-- according to bilateral agreements between network operators and/or equipment vendors.
-- The last octet of the standard part is indicated by bit 7 being set to 0, otherwise Bit 7 of
-- a standard part octet is set to 1 indicating that the standard part continues in the following
-- octet. Coding is as follows:
-- Octet 1 Standard Part for CAP
-- Bit Value Meaning
-- 0 0 IPRoutingAddress not supported
-- 1 IPRoutingAddress supported
-- 1 0 VoiceBack not supported
-- 1 VoiceBack supported
-- 2 0 VoiceInformation not supported, via speech recognition
-- 1 VoiceInformation supported, via speech recognition
-- 3 0 VoiceInformation not supported, via voice recognition
-- 1 VoiceInformation supported, via voice recognition
-- 4 0 Generation of voice announcements from Text not supported
-- 1 Generation of voice announcements from Text supported
-- 5 - Reserved
-- 6 - Reserved
-- 7 0 End of standard part
-- 1 This value is reserved in CAP
-- -- Octets 2 to 4 Bilateral Part: Network operator/equipment vendor specific
