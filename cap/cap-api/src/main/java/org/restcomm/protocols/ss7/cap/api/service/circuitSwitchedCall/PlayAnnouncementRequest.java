-- Direction: gsmSCF -> gsmSRF, Timer: T pa
-- This operation is to be used after Establish Temporary Connection (assist procedure
-- with a second gsmSSF) or a Connect to Resource (no assist) operation. It may be used
-- for inband interaction with a mobile station, or for interaction with an ISDN user.
-- In the former case, the gsmSRF is usually collocated with the gsmSSF for standard
-- tones (congestion tone...) or standard announcements.
-- In the latter case, the gsmSRF is always collocated with the gsmSSF in the switch.
-- Any error is returned to the gsmSCF. The timer associated with this operation must
-- be of a sufficient duration to allow its linked operation to be correctly correlated.
