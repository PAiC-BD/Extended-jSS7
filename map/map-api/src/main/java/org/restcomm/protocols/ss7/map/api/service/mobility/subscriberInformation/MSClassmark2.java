MS-Classmark2 ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (3))
-- This parameter carries the value part of the MS Classmark 2 IE defined in
-- 3GPP TS 24.008 [35].

10.5.1.6 Mobile Station Classmark 2
The purpose of the Mobile Station Classmark 2 information element is to provide the network with information
concerning aspects of both high and low priority of the mobile station equipment. This affects the manner in which the
network handles the operation of the mobile station. The Mobile Station Classmark information indicates general
mobile station characteristics and it shall therefore, except for fields explicitly indicated, be independent of the
frequency band of the channel it is sent on.
The Mobile Station Classmark 2 information element is coded as shown in figure 10.5.6/3GPP TS 24.008,
table 10.5.6a/3GPP TS 24.008 and table 10.5.6b/3GPP TS 24.008.
The Mobile Station Classmark 2 is a type 4 information element with 5 octets length.

octet 1: Mobile station classmark
octet 2: Length of mobile station classmark 2 contents
octet 3: 8:0 spare - 7,6:Revision level - 5:ES IND 4:A5/1 - 3,2,1: RF power capability
octet 4: 8:0 spare - 7:PS capa. - 6,5:SS Screen.Indicator - 4:SM capabi. - 3:VBS - 2:VGCS - 1:FC
octet 5: 8:CM3 0 - 7:0 spare - 6:LCSVA CAP - 5:UCS2 - 4:SoLSA - 3:CMSP - 2:A5/3 - 1:A5/2
