/**
 *
 Time ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (4)) -- Octets are coded according to IETF RFC 3588 [139]
 *
 * The Time format is derived from the OctetString AVP Base Format. The string MUST contain four octets, in the same format as
 * the first four bytes are in the NTP timestamp format. The NTP Timestamp format is defined in chapter 3 of [SNTP].
 *
 * This represents the number of seconds since 0h on 1 January 1900 with respect to the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
 *
 * On 6h 28m 16s UTC, 7 February 2036 the time value will overflow. SNTP [SNTP] describes a procedure to extend the time to
 * 2104. This procedure MUST be supported by all DIAMETER nodes.
 *
 * For "NTP Timestamp Format" please refer rfc2030.
