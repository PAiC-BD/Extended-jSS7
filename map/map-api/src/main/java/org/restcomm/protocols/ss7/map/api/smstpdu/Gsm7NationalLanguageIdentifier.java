/**
 * User data header for National Language Locking Shift & National Language Single Shift (Gsm7 encoding)
 *
 * The national language tables are used for adding the special characters of certain languages that cannot be expressed using
 * the GSM default 7 bit alphabet. The principle is to use the National Language Identifier to indicate to a receiving entity
 * that the message has been encoded using a national language table. Both single shift and locking shift mechanisms are
 * defined. The single shift mechanism, as defined in subclause 6.2.1.2.2, applies to a single character and it replaces the GSM
 * 7 bit default alphabet extension table defined in subclause 6.2.1.1 with a National Language Single Shift Table (see
 * subclause A.2). The locking shift mechanism, as defined in subclause 6.2.1.2.3, applies throughout the message, or the
 * current segment in case of a concatenated message, and it replaces the GSM 7 bit default alphabet defined in subclause 6.2.1
 * with a National Language Locking Shift Table (see subclause A.3) that defines the whole character set needed for the
 * language. In case that several languages are used, which require different national language tables, it is recommended to
 * encode the message in UCS-2, however it is possible to use both single shift and locking shift with the corresponding tables
 * in a single message. Implementations based on older reference versions (so-called "legacy implementations") will use the
 * fallback mechanisms that are defined in the earlier versions of the specification for handling of unknown characters.
 *
 * Look at 3GPP TS 23.038
