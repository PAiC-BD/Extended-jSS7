 E-UTRAN-CGI ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (7))

 -- Octets are coded as described in 3GPP TS 29.118.
 ==E-UTRAN Cell Global Identity: 3GPP TS 29.118: The E-UTRAN Cell Global Identity information element indicates the UE's
 current E-UTRAN Cell Global Identity. The coding of the E-UTRAN Cell Global Identity value is according to ECGI field
 information element as specified in subclause 8.21.5 of 3GPP TS 29.274 [17A]

 ETSI TS 129 274: ECGI field The coding of ECGI (E-UTRAN Cell Global Identifier) is depicted in Figure 8.21.5-1. Only zero or
 one ECGI field shall be present in ULI IE. Bits Octets 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 e MCC digit 2 MCC digit 1 e+1 MNC digit 3 MCC digit 3
 e+2 MNC digit 2 MNC digit 1 e+3 Spare ECI e+4 to e+6 ECI (E-UTRAN Cell Identifier) The E-UTRAN Cell Identifier (ECI) consists
 of 28 bits. The ECI field shall start with Bit 4 of octet e+3, which is the most significant bit. Bit 1 of Octet e+6 is the
 least significant bit. The coding of the E-UTRAN cell identifier is the responsibility of each administration. Coding using
 full hexadecimal representation shall be used.
