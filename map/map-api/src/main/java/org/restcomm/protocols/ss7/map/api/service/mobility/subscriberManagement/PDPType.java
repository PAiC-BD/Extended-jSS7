<code>
PDP-Type ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (2))
-- Octets are coded according to TS 3GPP TS 29.060 [105]
-- Only the values PPP, IPv4 and IPv6 are allowed for this parameter.

Byte 0:
bits 8-5: Spare  1 1 1 1
bits 4-1: PDP Type Organization
Byte 1:
PDP Type Number

PDP Type Organisation Values:
ETSI: 0
IETF: 1

ETSI defined PDP Type Values:
PPP: 1

IETF defined PDP Type Values:
IPv4 Address: PDP Type Number = HEX(21) = 33
IPv6 Address: PDP Type Number = HEX(57) = 87

For PPP the PDP Type Organisation is ETSI and the PDP Type Number is 1 and there shall be no address in the End
User Address IE. In this case the address is negotiated later as part of the PPP protocol.
