 TA-Id ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (5))
 -- Octets are coded as described in 3GPP TS 29.118.

 ==Tracking Area Identity: 3GPP TS 29.118: Octets 3 to 7 contain the value part of the Tracking Area Identity information
 element defined in 3GPP TS 24.301 [14] (starting with octet 2, i.e. not including 3GPP TS 24.301 IEI)

 3GPP TS 24.301: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 MCC digit 2 MCC digit 1 octet 2 MNC digit 3 MCC digit 3 octet 3 MNC digit 2 MNC digit 1 octet
 4 TAC octet 5 TAC (continued) octet 6

 MCC, Mobile country code (octet 2 and 3) The MCC field is coded as in ITU-T Rec. E212 [30], annex A. If the TAI is deleted
 the MCC and MNC shall take the value from the deleted TAI. In abnormal cases, the MCC stored in the UE can contain elements
 not in the set {0, 1 ... 9}. In such cases the UE should transmit the stored values using full hexadecimal encoding. When
 receiving such an MCC, the network shall treat the TAI as deleted. MNC, Mobile network code (octet 3 bits 5 to 8, octet 4)
 The coding of this field is the responsibility of each administration, but BCD coding shall be used. The MNC shall consist of
 2 or 3 digits. For PCS 1900 for NA, Federal regulation mandates that a 3-digit MNC shall be used. However a network operator
 may decide to use only two digits in the MNC in the TAI over the radio interface. In this case, bits 5 to 8 of octet 3 shall
 be coded as "1111". Mobile equipment shall accept a TAI coded in such a way. In abnormal cases, the MNC stored in the UE can
 have: - digit 1 or 2 not in the set {0, 1 ... 9}, or - digit 3 not in the set {0, 1 ... 9, F} hex. In such cases the UE shall
 transmit the stored values using full hexadecimal encoding. When receiving such an MNC, the network shall treat the TAI as
 deleted. The same handling shall apply for the network, if a 3-digit MNC is sent by the UE to a network using only a 2-digit
 MNC. TAC, Tracking area code (octet 5 and 6) In the TAC field bit 8 of octet 5 is the most significant bit and bit 1 of octet
 6 the least significant bit. The coding of the tracking area code is the responsibility of each administration except that
 two values are used to mark the TAC, and hence the TAI, as deleted. Coding using full hexadecimal representation may be used.
 The tracking area code consists of 2 octets. If a TAI has to be deleted then all bits of the tracking area code shall be set
 to one with the exception of the least significant bit which shall be set to zero. If a USIM is inserted in a mobile
 equipment with the tracking area code containing all zeros, then the mobile equipment shall recognise this TAC as part of a
 deleted TAI.
