/**
 * <p>
 * A multiplex of {@link ShellSelectableChannel} objects.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A selector may be created by invoking the {@link #open open} method of this class, which will use the system's default
 * {@link ChannelProvider </code>selector provider<code>} to create a new selector. A selector remains open until it is closed
 * via its {@link #close close} method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A selectable channel's registration with a selector is represented by a {@link ChannelSelectionKey} object. A selector
 * maintains one set of selection keys:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * <p>
 * The <i>selected-key set</i> is the set of keys such that each key's channel was detected to be ready for at least one of the
 * operations identified in the key's interest set during a selection operation. This set is returned by the {@link #selectNow()
 * selectNow} method.
 * </p>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Every time {@link #selectNow() selectNow} method is called the <i>selected-key set</i> is cleared before adding keys that are
 * ready for operation
